The OpenDoor System was developed and built by @roba91 and the Android App was devloped by @ayonix


## Why is this App not on the AppStore

*  To deploy an App to the Apple AppStore you require an official Apple Developer licence, which is 99â‚¬ per year. Money I cannot afford for a small App like this
*  This app would probably not pass Apples quality tests to actually make it to the AppStore

## How to get it

If you have a Mac just clone this repository, build it with XCode and install it onto your iOS device.

If you don't have a Mac you can hit me up in the Fachschaft and I can install it on your iOS device for you.
